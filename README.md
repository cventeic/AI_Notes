# AI_Notes
I spend a significant amount of time thinking about what it may take for machines to more fully and productively interact with the world.  This Repo contains my notes and ideas.

## Ungrouped Scans

I have collected many pages of notes.  This directory contains pdfs created by
scanning the notes.  Ultimately I would like to convert most significant
concepts from these notes into a set of markdown documents.


## Concept documents

This directory contains markdown documents describing concepts I think are
important.

The content of the markdown documents is often derived from the hand written
notes stored as pdf files in the Ungrouped Scans directory.

Generally the markdown documents can be rendered to pdf using the scripts
provided in the directory.

Ex:
  bundle exec ruby render.rb AI_notes.md
  pdflatex -halt-on-error -output-directory pdf AI_notes.md.latex
